                            Hi, my name is Jinyuan Chen.
                            I'm an international student based in Brisbane, QLD specializing in building and occasionally designing exceptional, high-quality websites and applications.
                            I studied for a Bachelor of Construction Management and Quantity Surveyor at Bond University and graduated in 2019. 
                            Now I continue to pursue a Master of Information Technology at the University of Queensland.
                            I was very interested in computer from an early age. 
                            I love to explore and research a variety of computer software, especially in terms of website design and software development.

                              <p>In the Design Exploration, I ended up with a poster designed for my ideal website and an excellent presentation.
                              I participated in brainstorming activity to explore my project. Here are some ideas I generated at the beginning：
                              </p>
                              <p>1.	Real estate maps - Provide housing information to people.</p>
                              <p>2.	Change in density in residential areas - Provide information to real estate developers or commercial builders.
                              </p>
                              <p>3.	Registered Vehicles by color - Suggestions for people who want to buy a car.</p>
                              <p>4.	Public Toilets - Help people looking for toilets.</p>
                              <p>5.	Flood Study - Provides a reference for builders.</p>
                              <p>6.	Number of endangered species - Information for organizations or people who love animals.</p>
                              
                              <p>Firstly, I got inspiration for the development of my conceptual idea by doing brainstorm. Brainstorming is a good research method I used because it's convenient, efficient, and easy, especially when a group of people brainstorms together, new ideas were easy to produce. 
                              </p>
                              <p>The method I also used was mind maps. My bachelor major was related to construction, property and city planning; therefore, the first idea came up with in my mind was about real estate, and then I thought deep in it and generated more relative topics according to real estate.

                              <p>The "6 Thinking Hats" method is a good method helped generate a lot of inspiration in my personal project. It is a thinking approach for moving forward in the design process that evaluating ideas, discussing progress and issues to avoid confrontational arguments.
                              </p>
                              <p>Also, I had used other method such as comparison of similar existing products. My key inspiration got from a similar existing website called Gold Coast city plan interactive mapping. I have used that website before, but I found it was complicated because it contains many different colorful map layers, which made me difficult to find the information I want on the map. Therefore, it influenced my design idea that to build a simple, prospective and also interactive website that collect the most important information and make them more sense to the users.
                              </p>
                              <p>Figure below is my imaginary website. I referred to the interactive mapping in the Gold Coast City Planning website. Relatively, the interface and functions are simpler, but the content inside is more focus on users.

                            <p>In the Part A, I joined a team! We produced a good Pitch together and generated a design proposal of our website concept.
                            </p>
                            <p>Firstly, we used a World Cafe method to explore our different idea topics that were generated from the Design Exploration. In the activity, I explored 5 different topics and saw other student's posters. I thought everyone's posters were excellent, but I found that most of the problems were that the words on the posters were too much. I thought a good poster should be simple, the picture was mostly proportioned, and the text just needed to put the important points on it. 
                            </p>
                            <p>In addition, during the exploration process, I left some new opinions and ideas on the big paper. For example, in the Event&Service topic, I suggested that we could make a ranking system that allowed users to know the sales rankings of various vehicles.</p>
                            <p>
                            In the emergency topic, we designed a website to bring together various related posters into a new website, an interactive map that provided real-time traffic safety information to users.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In the water topic, we designed a website about fishing based on the database we owned, providing users with a place suitable for fishing and including fishing teaching.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            In the indigenous culture and Language topic, we analyzed the ideas and suggestions left by other students before, and then published some shortcomings about the project. For example, if the language range was too wide, the database was difficult to find, so it could be considered narrowing it down to teach only a few common dialects.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            I learned that I needed to maintain enough enthusiasm in the discussion. I needed to actively participate in discussions on different topics. As a participant, after a topic discussion time, I needed to immediately convert my identity to participate in the discussion of another topic. As a moderator, I needed to record ideas and issues in time for the next group of participants to describe.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            After this event, I found a group of people who shared my interests ,then we formed the Team 15.

                            <p>In the following week, I did a lot of work. Our group has a good atmosphere and I able to articulate my ideas and communicate those to the other team members. In the process of designing the website page, I gave some advice on web design. For example, I proposed whether we can design our website by referring to the design of the button floating on the map in the previous student's work, and then they all thought that my idea was very good and finally adopted my opinion. 
                            </p>
                            <p>This was a success process that including my ideas with others. I thought this helped to promote better development, based on a big premise (the same project theme). For example, for the design on the homepage, everyone had their own different ideas, and then we took the essence and discarded the dregs. In the end, there will be a product that everyone is satisfied with.
                            </p>
                            <p>We had arranged everyone's plans through effective communication and assignment of work. Everyone's division of work was arranged by leader. We got a WeChat group chat, except on the Trello. In order to make our communication more clear and effective, we had always been in touch. And we decided to take time to meet at least once a week in addition to class. Then our proposal was written on Google Docs so that everyone can track everyone's progress in real time.

                            <p>I used concept tool liked use-case scenario, mind map, and storyboard to conceptualise components of our project. The project idea we got was inspired by recently several robbery and homicide occurred around southern of Brisbane, particularly close to the Sunnybank. We made brainstorming and generated some ideas on how to present relevant information to users on our website.

                            <p>Map, side menu, interactive homepage, and buttons were the components that we thought the most easily to realize. We wanted to created products with just enough features to satisfy early customers and provide feedback for future product development.

                            <p>Our team's MVP was a website that abled to successfully display the corresponding crime event and its correct location on the map by clicking the crime type button. For example, as shown in the figure above. When user clicked on the Murder button, it could show the murder event on the map with its location and then clicked on that location pin it could pop up a message box to show the detailed information about that event.</p>
                            <p>The following is the MVP developed for the stage of presentation of our demo, representing the basic concepts of our project:</p>
                            <p>1. Combine SLQ and the map of Brisbane.</p>

                            <p>3. Review and rate regional security.</p>
                            <p>According to the MVP, we improved the user flow through the project web application:</p>

                            <p>During this period, the good thing was that we could have a preliminary goal or milestone for our group and let us build a positive team attitude. We will achieve this goal first and then move towards the ultimate goal. And this initial goal was to be able to show users the basic functions of our products, so it was also difficult.</p>
                            <p>So, the bad side was that there existed some technical problems that our team had not yet been able to master it. There will be difficulties in the later stage, which will affect our confidence in completion.</p>
                            <p>This process was not bad. We found some points that we wanted to show to the user, and most could be achieved. In addition to the main features and topics related information, we wanted to combine a dataset of housing pricing so that the changes of housing pricing will be displayed as a form of line chart to users when they clicked on the "Read More" option in the message box. However, it was a huge workload, because the dataset of housing price was too big to categorize them.</p>
                            <p>A good MVP was a working, usable product. I might have done the following steps to improve the process of determining and achieving our MVP:</p>
                            <p>Step 1: Market researched and investigated similar websites and analyze their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
                            <p>Step 2: Expressed, communicated and shared my ideas with the team.</p>
                            <p>Step 3: Considered the design process and user flow.</p>
                            <p>Step 4: Listed the project features.</p>
                            <p>Step 5: Determined and built our MVP.</p>
                            <p>Step 6: Measured, tested and learned.</p>
                            <p>From Part B I learned that in future courses, I will use approach such as identify the problem → solve the problem to determine a successful MVP. To do this, I will distill user problem and the proposed solution into their most basic forms. Next, narrow in on the features that solve that one key problem. Finally, the MVP ’s core features must directly address that problem.</p>

                            <p>Our team developed detailed plans and tasks for each member's work with the goal of completing the final project. After the demo demonstration in the week 10, we got a lot of feedback from the tutor. We followed this feedback to improve our project one by one. Most of the code had been completed before the demo stage, and our MVP had achieved the original ideal effect. The next step was mainly to focus on our reports, and the addition of some interactive features. </p>
                            <p>In order to ensure tasks will be complete on time, I reminded the team members in the chat group and confirmed the progress of each team member's tasks. While we had questions that we did not understand, we cloud ask everyone in the chat group. And everyone could get the answer in time, which effectively helped us solve problems faster.</p>

So, I thought about designing and building the part of the interface in a formal, serious, and official style. The way I used user interaction was simple and straightforward, and it allowed users to feel that our web application was trustworthy. </p>
                            <p>The design of the menu and navigation bar did not make the user feel fancy, it made it easy for users to find the information they needed and leaded the user to other pages. I was quite satisfied with the interaction design of the buttons. Because the different crime buttons was connected to the back-end dataset of crime information and I made them float on the crime map, the user was allowed to click one of the buttons and then the corresponding crime information could be displayed on the map.</p>

                            <p>I felt very good about the aspect of the interaction design of our project. At least it could present a trustworthy feeling to the target user, rather than a fancy feeing like an entertainment website. This was especially important for our project web application on the theme of the crime prevention. Our interaction design was simple and straightforward, allowing users to immediately know what they should do next. Users could predict the next action through the given feedback from the website. </p>
                            <p>However, the style characteristics and pattern of our theme constrained the design of our project interaction with the user to some extent. So, I could hardly imagine how to add more interactive functions in our web application. Regarding this, I considered and discussed in the team for a long time, and finally came up with a solution that further added interactive functions based on the original interaction.</p>
                            <p>For example, an instruction message was added on the mapping page which helped users to use the website. A new "Read More" option was added to the pop-up message box of the crime information on our original map. When the user clicks on this option, a new message box could be popped up and showed the review and star rating system functions in the container.</p>

                            <p>I have been very fulfilling this semester, and I have participated in all Lectures, Workshops and Contacts of DECO7180, from the first week to the thirteenth week, and I have a record of the journaling every week. In the following, I will show some parts of the Journaling and their links.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-1-5d3da1aea6a79">Week 1</a>, I was introduced what I can expect for the contact session in this semester. From the ice breaking activity, I got to know my contact peers and tutors and introduced myself through some interesting questions.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-2-5d46cb9513e51">Week 2</a>, I learned some basic aspects of application programming interface (API). I started my new trip on learning how to use photoshop and adobe illustrator. I visualized some ideas I have identified for my personal project.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-3-5d500c9a59d34">Week 3</a>, I did a group discussion on developing our ideas. We grouped of six and each member presented two of their ideas, and then we chose one idea to discuss using the "6 Thinking Hats" method.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-4-5d510c37a7ac3">Week 4</a>, I continued to work on my poster and practice my pitch. This week due to the EKKA holiday, I have changed both my Contact class(CO3) and Workshop(WO2) on Monday. In the Contact, Jason talked about my process with me. He gave me some great ideas that had inspired me on how to present well in my Pitch. In the Workshop, Alina also gave me advices and confidence about how to build my poster. Thank they a lot!</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-6-5d6bcc4aa3441">Week 6</a>, we used the World Cafe method to explore the overarching topics that were generated from the Design Exploration. Each of the submitted posters into a topic had been placed on tables and we used the World Cafe method to explore their Context, Audience/Domain and Refine. </p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-7-5d74db6cb9cc9">Week 7</a>, we formed Team 15 to work on our Part A Design Proposal, and we consider all peoples' ideas in deciding on the new team project.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-8-5d7aa07418cd1">Week 8</a>, we made a Pitch and finished our design proposal report in this week. We produced a concept paper and presentation describing what we wanted to produce for our website and how it used the SLQ data. This was based on our “design exploration” assessment.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-9-5d830e8f910a4">Week 9</a>, we worked on the Part B Demo Demonstration. We successfully identify our team's MVP and completed some of them. We were ready to demonstrate our partially implemented websites in Week 10. We had demonstrated the key technical and interactive features of our website, along with any changes to the original design.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-11-5da358bde64a6">Week 11</a>, we developed detailed plans and tasks for each member's work with the goal of completing the final project. Most of the code had been completed before the demo stage, and our MVP had achieved the original ideal effect. The next step was mainly to focus on our reports, and the addition of some interactive features.</p>
                            <p>In <a href="https://ixd-deco7180.uqcloud.net/journals/week-12-5da358cf17446">Week 12</a>, we almost implemented our final project. The next studio session will be our trade show, we will complete and submit our report by the deadline and apply further improvements to our website before the trade show. We used a simulation test to allow some users to experience our projects ahead of time and then left feedback. We collected these feedbacks and made final adjustments to our projects before the launch to ensure that all interaction designs and functionality were improved and could be used.</p>

                            <p>This portfolio documents and reflects upon projects I completed over the semester. The aim of the portfolio is for me to highlight and reflect upon my achievements over the semester and communicate my work to a wider audience. This portfolio contains:</p>
                            <p>-Curated documentation of individual contributions to the major project, including description of and reflection on individual process.</p>
                            <p>-Reflection on project outcomes.</p>
                            <p>-Reflection on the course as a whole.</p>
                            <p>This portfolio provides evidence of my capabilities and an insight into my design process. Reflections critically analyses the positives and negatives of the work I completed, as well as the approaches I took along the way.</p>
                            <p>The portfolio is only a single webpage with section navigation to join the content together into a cohesive webpage present the content clearly and concisely. My design philosophy is to create a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere, so I chose light colors such as pink and white to accompany my website, with pure music with beautiful melodies, and simple navigation.</p>

                            <em>•	Meeting expectations:</em>
                            <p>In my first journal I posted that “Based on my understanding of this course, I look forward to completing all the projects in this semester. I hope that I can learn a lot of skills. I also hope to have a good relationship with the team members and the tutors. I want to learn a variety of web design, programming skills, PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT and API and more. I am worried about the new knowledge I have not learned, because I am afraid that I can't keep up with the progress. After all, I don't have much programming experience.”.</p>
                            <p>Fortunately, most of these expectations have been met. I have completed all the projects in this semester and learned a lot of new programming skills. Although I met some difficulties sometime, I finally addressed those with nice team members and tutors’ help.</p>
                            <p>Some expectations may not have met my goal, because the time is too short, this semester is too busy, I also want to learn more about PHP. I have not revised my expectations because I feel that as long as I can complete most of my original expectations, it will be satisfied for me.</p>
                            <em>•	Learning across the course:</em>
                            <p>I learned a lot from the various activities I attended throughout the course. I learned some basic aspects of application programming interface (API). I imaged API in my mind that there was a house and there were many rooms in the house, each room had its role such as bedroom, bathroom and kitchen, and there were doors with name brand indicated the room name between each room and the house. In this image, the house just liked the website to hold the whole content, rooms just liked functions, and API in here seemed to be the door.</p>
                            <p>I also learned to use different idea generating methods such brainstorming, mind map, and storyboard. I learned to use “6 Thinking Hats ” method in the design process that evaluating ideas, discussing progress and issues to avoid confrontational arguments.</p>
                            <p>I learned to use a World Cafe method to explore our different idea topics. During the activity, I have learned some benefits and drawbacks of the method. Firstly, it was a flexible method and also relatively inexpensive to organize. The short discussion sessions and the participants’ enthusiasm made sure that the discussions did not get the chance to fail and everyone could voice their opinion. </p>
                            <p>This led to high quality conclusions. The moderator also discussed the same subject several times, which allowed him to avoid substantive pitfalls that occurred in a previous discussion, from reoccurring in a subsequent discussion. This allowed moderator to remain on theme, which had a positive influence on the end result. Combined with the fact that the participants was always changing, this ensured that moderator had the choice to delve deeper into recurring elements, or to further investigate new elements.</p>
                            <p>However, the method requires a lot of preparation time in preparing the content as well as the actual and organizational elements. Dealing with discussions was also a time consuming task. Some of the discussions suddenly stopped because the scheduled 8 minutes had passed too fast. </p>
                            <p>Even if the discussion was still very active, people must stop and move on. In addition, the same group will conduct the next discussion each time, and sometimes some ideas will be obtained from the previous discussion, but the moderator was not always informed, which may have an impact on the discussion.</p>
                            <p>After that I learned that I need to maintain enough enthusiasm in the discussion. I need to actively participate in discussions on different topics. As a participant, after a topic discussion time, I need to immediately convert my identity to participate in the discussion of another topic. As a moderator, I need to record ideas and issues in time for the next group of participants to describe.</p>
                            <em>•	Changes to improve experience of the course:</em>
                            <p>I take every assessment seriously, which is very important to me. For me, the course, projects, teams, and assessments are set up and arranged very well. The entire semester was very fulfilling and there was no waste. This course taught me a lot of things I have never learned before, and I have met many new friends and experienced different teamwork tasks. This makes me feel that this experience will be helpful to my future career.</p>
